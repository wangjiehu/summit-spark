# Changelog

## 2026-06-05 - p20

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p20`.
- Split mobile touch controls into direction and action clusters with safer hit targets.
- Added non-sensitive gamepad axis magnitude and near-deadzone status for real controller tuning.
- Reduced default audio gains so movement and death feedback are less fatiguing.
- Improved late-room wind, crumble, and prism readability without adding default tutorial copy.
- Simplified the finish review surface: primary cards stay visible, extra review detail and the mastery roadmap are collapsible.

## 2026-06-05 - p19

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p19`.
- Quieted normal gameplay by removing visible fall/death correction cards, route arrows, death marks, death replays, and first-input timing prompts.
- Reworked settings into a controls-first system panel: Controls is the only default-open group, with Audio and Display split into separate groups.
- Updated smoke, contract, route, and Feel checks so quality gates preserve the quiet play mode instead of requiring old coaching overlays.
- Refined settings typography, spacing, and button weights toward a cleaner single-column options surface.

## 2026-06-05 - p18

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p18`.
- Removed explanatory start-screen copy and the visible control guide.
- Defaulted all settings groups to collapsed so the panel opens as a cleaner system-style index.
- Suppressed automatic beginner/death coaching toasts; necessary storage, diagnostics, and error feedback remains.
- Lightened UI typography and canvas HUD text from heavy 800/900 weights toward a calmer system-font hierarchy.
- Replaced the large room-intro teaching card with a compact room/target chip that does not render behind the start screen.

## 2026-06-05 - p17

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p17`.
- Reduced start-screen copy and first-room onboarding prompts.
- Reworked settings into grouped disclosure sections so only Training and Room are open by default.

## 2026-06-05 - p16

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p16`.

## 2026-06-05 - p15

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p15`.
- Added a feedback-template copy button that turns the current diagnostics context into a paste-ready report outline.

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p14`.
- Added feedback type and a short feedback note field to the review section.
- Diagnostics snapshots now include the current feedback type and sanitized note.

## 2026-06-05 - p13

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p13`.
- Added a settings-panel diagnostics copy button for local playtest feedback.
- Diagnostics snapshots include build, settings, viewport, storage presence, current run state, Route/Feel/Challenge summary, and progress counts.
- Diagnostics intentionally exclude user identity, user agent, raw input history, replay paths, and secrets.
- Browser smoke now clicks the diagnostics button and verifies the generated snapshot shape.
- HTTP smoke and contract checks now require diagnostics UI and helpers.

- Bumped public build assets to `20260605-p12`.
- Extended browser smoke to verify keyboard-only settings access through `O` and `Escape`.

- Added `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for real human/device verification limits and low-value next steps to avoid.
- Contract check now requires the manual playtest and known-issues docs to stay linked from release surfaces.
