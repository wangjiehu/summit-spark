# Known Issues

This file tracks real limits, not speculative wishlist items. Move an item here only when it affects public demo confidence or needs human/device verification beyond local scripts.

## Needs Human Or Device Verification

- Physical gamepad feel: browser smoke mocks a standard gamepad and deadzone logic, and the settings panel now reports non-sensitive connection status, but a real controller pass is still needed for stick drift, button layout comfort, and long-session grab fatigue.
- Real touch device feel: mobile smoke covers viewport fit and touch UI visibility through emulation; a phone or tablet pass is still needed for thumb reach, accidental presses, and browser chrome safe areas.
- Full 10-room human pass: scripts verify maps, state, and UI surfaces, but at least one uninterrupted human playthrough is still required before treating difficulty and teaching order as public-test stable.
- Online Pages freshness: local HTML asset versioning is guarded, but after any push the public URL still needs one live check to confirm it serves the intended build.
- Audio perception: headless smoke can verify the audio test path updates status, but volume balance and fatigue need a real listening pass.
- Diagnostics and feedback templates are local-only: snapshots and templates can include the current feedback type, note, viewport, training state, and gamepad summary, but there is no automatic upload or issue tracker integration.

## Current Product Boundaries

- The demo is a 10-room vertical slice, not a complete chapter campaign.
- Route contracts and Feel Lab are local training tools; they do not yet produce exportable replay data.
- Long-term profile data is localStorage-based and intentionally lightweight; p16 adds local JSON export/import with import preview and invalid-import guards, but there is no cloud sync.
- Low-performance mode reduces visual budget only. If a low-end device still struggles, the next fix should target render cost, not gameplay simplification.

## Not Worth Fixing Right Now

- Adding more rooms before one human pass clears R1-R10 with useful feedback. More content would hide route readability problems.
- Adding a second achievement system. Chapter completion and long-term challenges already reuse PB/Clean/S/Style/Expert/Flow data.
- Making `npm run check` require a browser executable. Browser smoke remains available as a stronger local gate, but the default check should stay runnable in constrained CI.
