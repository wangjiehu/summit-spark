# Release Checklist

Use this before publishing a public demo update.

1. Run `npm run check`.
2. Run `npm run state-check` if training state, resume, or storage schema changed.
3. Run `npm run browser-smoke` on a machine with Chrome or Edge.
4. Run `git diff --check`.
5. Confirm `index.html` and `summit-spark.html` are identical.
6. Confirm the build version in HTML and asset query strings matches the intended release.
7. Start `npm start` and open the local page once.
8. Verify the start button, direct resume button when progress exists, settings panel, one Route contract, one Feel Lab card, audio test, keyboard `O/Escape`, and settings close path.
9. Confirm settings opens with only Controls expanded by default; Audio, Display, Room, Feedback/Save, Profile, Training, and Advanced remain reachable.
10. Verify one Route interruption/resume and one Feel Lab interruption manually or through `npm run browser-smoke`.
11. Add a short feedback note, click the diagnostics copy button once, and confirm it produces a local feedback snapshot without uploading data.
12. Click feedback template copy once and confirm the template includes build, viewport, current training state, and blank reproduction fields.
13. Export a `summit-spark-save` archive, paste invalid JSON once to confirm the preview catches it without refreshing, then import a valid archive into a clean profile or rely on `npm run browser-smoke`; confirm settings/progress survive normalization.
14. Verify mobile viewport around 390x700 and 700x390 has no horizontal scroll or clipped settings controls.
15. Verify touch controls use separate direction/action clusters and stay at least 44px on mobile.
16. Verify corrupted storage recovery by relying on `npm run browser-smoke` or manually seeding bad localStorage.
17. Run the relevant parts of `PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md` for any public demo release.
18. Update `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` if a manual pass finds friction that is real but not fixed in this release.
19. Update `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SUPER_PUSH_PLAN.md`, `PLAYTEST_CHECKLIST.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` when user-facing behavior changes.
