# Summit Spark Roadmap

## North Star

Build an original precision platformer whose identity is not imitation, but mastery: instant controls, readable rooms, fast retry, and a signature movement language built around dash afterglow, spark hops, wall rhythm, and risky light relays.

## What We Must Beat

- Feel: every input should be immediate, legible, and recoverable.
- Teaching: rooms should introduce one idea safely, then ask for it under pressure.
- Practice: deaths should be fast, informative, and almost frictionless.
- Identity: spark hop and light relay chains must become our own expressive mechanic.
- Presentation: effects should clarify player state without visual noise.

## Current Pillars

- Direction keys are direction only; jump, dash, and grab stay separate.
- Spark hop: a tiny post-dash jump window turns dash momentum into a learned technique.
- Wall rhythm: neutral wall jumps, away wall jumps, and grab wall jumps have distinct uses.
- Light trails are visual only; light relays provide limited, authored risk/reward extension.
- Wind updrafts, overdrive prisms, and echo anchors form the next original layer: route rhythm, skill ceiling, and fast practice.

## Progress Log

- 2026-05-29: Added death trajectory replays, relay-chain feedback, room split PBs, best-route ghosts, and current-room restart.
- 2026-05-29: Added wall coyote, fast fall, room target grades, persisted settings, comfort/classic key presets, and close-to-player input echo cues.
- 2026-05-29: Expanded the route to 10 rooms and added wind updrafts, overdrive prisms, echo anchors, Flow peak scoring, near-miss rewards, gamepad support, and final-run Flow reporting.
- 2026-05-30: Added room intro panels, dynamic best ghosts, current-route trails, practice-line settings, and summit mastery summary.
- 2026-05-30: Added split delta HUD, dash-aim preview, room-select practice, and automated map integrity checks.

## Next Milestones

1. Movement depth: tune spark hop, wall jump lock, wall coyote, fast fall, corner correction, input presets, gamepad feel, and grounded recovery.
2. Practice feedback: show run time, split time, room PBs, split grades, best-route ghosts, dynamic best ghosts, current-route trails, Flow peaks, deaths, room count, recent death marks, short death trajectory replays, input echo cues, and fast room restart.
3. Teaching vertical slice: refine the 10-room route so each mechanic has a safe intro, a pressured use, and an optional high-skill line.
4. Original mechanic pass: tune wind updrafts, overdrive prisms, echo anchors, light relays, and relay-chain feedback without enabling hovering.
5. Presentation pass: add action cues, better player states, successful-tech feedback, and clearer high-speed readability.
6. Public test loop: keep GitHub Pages updated, collect player feedback, and track known issues.

## Design Rules

- Never bind jump to up.
- Keep key presets explicit: comfort is C/X/Z, classic is Z/X/C, and neither uses up as jump.
- Never let visual particles become hidden platforms.
- Every new powerful mechanic needs a cooldown, cost, route constraint, or room-authored limit.
- Practice assists can reduce repetition, but they must not hide the timer or make mastery data meaningless.
- A room should be readable before it is difficult.
- Restart speed matters as much as spectacle.
- Practice data should help the player improve without adding menu friction.

## Precision Quality Gate

- Every room must pass automated size, tile, target, name, start, and summit-goal validation before publishing.
- Every practice feature must reduce uncertainty: show intent, show pace, or show route memory.
- New maps should add pressure gradually: safe intro, readable escalation, optional high-skill line, and a clean recovery path.
- Online builds must be checked after push so the public URL is never treated as finished just because local checks pass.
